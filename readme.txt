Places a Flickr flash badge in your sidebar as a widget and allows for enhanced size, tag, and transition control.

== Description ==

Flickr Flash Badge Widget places a standard Flickr flash badge in your sidebar to display your photos from Flickr.  Note that the flash object comes from Flickr.com and is not hosted from your server.  Your server just communicates with Flickr to get a special code, `magisterLudi`, which changes every 24 hours, and then embeds the flash badge from Flickr into your page.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the plugin into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enter your Flickr account details into the widget settings on the Sidebar Widgets page in your WordPress admin (see screenshot)
1. Drag the widget onto the sidebar where you want it on the Sidebar Widgets page in your WordPress admin.
